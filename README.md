# CalculateLeapYear

Write the program that finds the year with Java's year.

What is the year now?

Now the year is 366 days instead of 365 on the Gregorian calendar. This extra day (now day) is obtained by adding February 29 to February, which is normally 28 days.

How is the year calculated now?

As a general rule, the years of 4 years are strict for years:

1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024.
For those who can divide only 400 without staying in the times of 100 years, now years:

For example, 1200, 1600, 2000 years, but now 1700, 1800 and 1900 are no longer years.
The reason why those who can only be fully divided into 400 are now accepted for years is to eliminate the error caused by an astronomical year, not 365.25 days, but about 365,242 days.
